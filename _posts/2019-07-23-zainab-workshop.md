[Zainab](https://twitter.com/_zainabali_) offered us to give a great workshop about one topic chosen amongst:

* testing (scalatest, property based testing, testing implicit resolution, testing effects)
* optics (how to use monocle, possibly goggles)
* improving compile times (scalac-profiling etc)
