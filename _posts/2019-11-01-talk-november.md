Join us at Deliveroo for another round of London Scala Talks! This month, we'll be hearing from Joe Warren on lenses and Daniela Sfregola on functional programming. We look forward to seeing you!

# Joe Warren: Lessons Learned Building a van Laarhoven Lens Library

Sometimes called "The JQuery of DataTypes": Lenses and other Optics provide a clean functional interface to the common task of modifying complex data structures. Brushing over any practical use cases, this talk takes a magnifying glass to one particular Optics representation: van Laarhoven Lenses. We'll explore how building a van Laarhoven-based Lens Framework may require some of the lesser known Functors, and see if Lenses can shine a new light on how we think about Abstraction.

# Daniela Sfregola: FP: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

You are about to fall in love with Functional Programming, if not already. You are going to learn the good parts that are going to make your day-to-day life easier. But since nobody is perfect - not even FP -, you are also going to see its bad and ugly parts, and you'll discover how to deal with them: from learning challenges to performance issues on the JVM.
