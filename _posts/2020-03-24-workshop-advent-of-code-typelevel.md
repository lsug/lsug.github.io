</div>

<div markdown="1" class="lsug-location-step">

{:.lsug-location-step-description}
Exit 6 takes you on to a bridge. Follow the bridge, which takes you over the top of the traffic on York Road.  As you are leaving the bridge you will walk down some steps. The office is the big glass building to the left of these steps.
